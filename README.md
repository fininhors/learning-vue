## Setup
Setup and use requires [Git](https://git-scm.com/),
[Node JS (8.X.X or later)](https://nodejs.org/en/), and a text editor such as
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

If you're on a Mac, I'd suggest using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for installing the required
software listed in Setup.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cujarrett/basic-vue-js-web-app.git
cd basic-vue-js-web-app
npm install
```

## Build Setup
Install dependencies
``` bash
npm install
```

Lint code
```bash
npm run lint
```

Linting code and fix most errors
```bash
npm run lint-and-fix
```

Runs Continuous Integration (linting and tests)
```bash
npm run ci
```

Serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production with minification
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
```bash
npm run generate
```
